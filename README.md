# Gesture Recognition using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
Hand gesture recognition using Python and Keras. :raised_hand: :+1: :thumbsdown: :v: :fist: :ok_hand:

## Overview
- Gesture recognition is a field in computer science and language technology to interpret human gestures via mathematical algorithms.
- We aim to develop a Gesture Recognizing System for the deaf and dumb to improve communication for the deaf and dumb.
- These gestures would be implemented such that they are easy to perform, fast, efficient, and ensure an immediate response.
- Hand gestures that can represent ideas using unique shapes and finger orientation have a scope for human-machine interaction.
- Hand gestures recognition  technology allows operations of complex machines using only  a series of finger and hand movements, eliminating the need for 
  physical contact between the operator and the machine.
- UG Btech Minor Group Project(15IT375L) - Total 5 members.

## Results
In this project, we develop a real-time gesture-based HCI system that recognizes gestures only using one monocular camera and extend the system to the HRI case. The developed system relies on a CNN classifier to learn features and recognize gestures. We employ a series of steps to process the image and to segment the hand region before feeding it to the CNN classifier to improve the performance of the CNN classifier. 3,200 gesture images are collected to test the CNN classifier and demonstrate that the CNN classifier combined with our image processing steps can recognize gestures with high accuracy in real time.
